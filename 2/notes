Notes:
- Collect videos
- Code 
- Make the volume lower
- Figure out random
- Code commute
- Code breakfast
- Code work
- Code dinner
- Think abot the size (450px?)
The food aspect is the strongest should I just focus on these food videos

Questions:
How do I make it random? Can I do a thing where it chooses 4 out of the ones listed?
Is text necessary?
sound? nosound?
